# BloodLink

**BloodLink** is a web-based blood donation and request management platform that connects three key users: **Requesters**, **Donors**, and **Hospitals**. It aims to facilitate timely and safe blood transfusions by efficiently handling blood requests and donations with proper eligibility checks.

## Project Overview

BloodLink enables:

- **Requesters** to submit blood requests specifying blood type and quantity.
- **Donors** to register for donating blood and also request blood if needed.
- **Hospitals** to review, approve, or reject blood requests based on eligibility criteria and availability.

The system ensures all blood requests are validated carefully before approval, prioritizing safety and reliability in blood supply management.

4. Approved requests notify involved users for next steps.
5. The system maintains records of donations and requests.
